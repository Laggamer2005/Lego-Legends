# Lego-Legends
Lego Legends is a brand new fangame that is a planned revival of TT's Lego games. 

All TT Lego games will be here (Except Bionicle Heroes, Rock Band, and Portables) All the levels, characters, hub worlds, and even certain unique features will all be combined. Each game will have updated graphics in the Unreal 5.4 with beta and Experimental stuff with online multiplayer as well as the new mechanics featured in LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga. Along with the mumble mode, the game will also have retro graphics where the game will revert back to the classic LEGO graphics, as well as a retro camera mode which brings back the classic beat-em-up camera of the older LEGO games. In single player, the game will also have a party system to mimic the toy pad from LEGO Dimensions.

LSW:TCS

The levels will retain the blue minikits and super story will be a feature for all campaigns. The character shops will stay, but players can pull up the C-PAD whenever they want and buy characters there as well. The cantina will keep its design from the Skywalker Saga, but it will be much more open and will still have the level doors, the bonus room, and the outside area with Jabba the Hutt's room as well as the cliffside in LEGO Star Wars II. All of the characters on the roster will also be roaming around the Cantina area. The rest of Mos Eisley as seen in The Skywalker Saga will be accessible, but none of the trials, puzzles, or sidequests will be available if the player has not played The campaigns of TSS at all. Players will also be able to keep their studs from 1,000,000 stud challenges now, and this goes for all LEGO games. The co-op dueling feature will be reimplemented with the online multiplayer as an online PVP system in the game, and they will be part of the battle arena system.

LIJ

Similar to Complete Saga, the Barnett College will still be intact in free roam along with its character shop.

LB1

Since the Batcave has appeared in 5 LEGO games, it will be composited with the variation from LEGO Batman 3: Beyond Gotham as the foundation. The rest of Gotham and Arkham are also explorable, but none of the collectables will be available if you haven't started any of the other DC related campaigns. Once again, the character shop will remain and certain characters who are unlockable elsewhere will only be available to purchase in the Batcave's character shop. The suit upgrades for Batman and Robin will be part of the skill tree, however they will cost red bricks instead of gold bricks. The freeplay in LEGO LEGENDS will also function more similarly to this game along with the original three LEGO games in general as all of the cutscenes are removed in order to give the player more freedom since they already know the plot and what to do in the levels. The combat stud multipliers that were introduced in this game will also be making a return.

LIJ2

This was one of the games that changed the LEGO formula the most, however many of its features will still be intact. The hub worlds, however, will be separated accurately and the story will rely on fast travel similarly to Skywalker Saga for its progression. The top down camera will be changed as every game will feature the camera in Skywalker Saga. Along with this, players will be able to switch characters whenever they want instead of having to find them walking around the open world. The build your own adventure feature and the the level editor will return and they will be revamped to hold up to today’s standards. Despite only being a feature in two LEGO games, the level editor will be one of the biggest features in LEGO LEGENDS. Along with the reintroduction of online multiplayer, players will be able to publish their custom levels to the online database similar to Mario Maker.

LHP1/2

The character shop from Madam Malkin’s Robes will stay with the same system as the first three games, but the polyjuice potions will be removed as players will be able to pull up the C-Pad whenever they want and select characters there. Being the first LEGO game with DLC, the DLC will be in the base game rather than having to be purchased separately like it was before. Another big difference is that characters who aren't Harry, Ron, or Hermione will be unlocked if you play as them in the levels, instead of them still being locked even after completing certain levels. There will also be extra gold bricks to replace the missing collectables in free roam. Hogwarts will also be composited with the one in LEGO Dimensions featuring the massive open landscape of that adventure world along with the expanded interiors of the one in this game. Hogwarts will also have a dynamic weather system to fit both the sunny, snowy, and rainy appearances it features in all LEGO games. The pre-level exclusive locations will also be part of the open world this time.

LSW3

The Venator and Invisible Hand will be composited with the ones in Skywalker Saga as all of the areas will be combined. Along with this, all of the other capital ships from other LEGO games will adapt the exact panel where they can travel to different systems and access ground battles. The planet systems will be treated in a similar way to Kijimi in the open world, but they will retain their gold brick challenges. The levels will still have classic versions of characters as Minikit unlockables, however all of them will based on their earliest Minifigure appearances whether it be a set or a video game. The exclusive characters such as Shadow Stormtrooper, Darth Vader (Battle Damaged), and Starkiller will have modern designs instead.

LPOTC

The red hats will be replaced with red bricks along with the other variations to red bricks in other LEGO games. On top of this, any character who has the tracking ability will be able to use Jack Sparrow's Pirate Wheel in the levels and The hub.

LB2

The Gotham City in this game will serve as the foundation and main layout of Gotham, featuring many additions from LEGO DC Super-Villains such as many of the interiors, aesthetics, and new areas. The DLC heroes will be added into the game as other gold brick doors, and the villains will be added as extra mini bosses.

LOTR

The Mithril bricks function the same way but they will be replaced by gold bricks along with all other variations of gold bricks. The Mithril Items will be in a new section of the menu and any character will be able to access them.

LCU

The disguise booth system in this game will be completely removed along with the class system and the new character grid design. Super Bricks will also replace the currency used for all renovations and objects will still drop bricks along with studs in the LEGO City hub and levels. The vehicle customizer will also be reimplemented for all vehicles. As usual, all Super Mario Bros content will be exclusive to the Nintendo versions of the game.

LMSH

The big fig customizer will be completely remastered to be a proper customizer instead of a recolor tool, and it will be on the same level of quality as the current LEGO character customizers. The Manhattan in free roam will be the biggest hub world by far as well, featuring the Manhattan in the LEGO Marvel games as the base and other locations from Ghostbusters and Gremlins added on.

TLM

Instead of being exclusive to the levels and the bonus room, giant MetalBeard will be freely playable whenever the player wants as long as the room can fit him. The golden instruction builds in general will always be available in the hubs and Lord Business' legs will be a transformation instead of being activated with the switches. As for the hubs themselves, they will all be combined together in one massive open world at the end of the campaign similarly to how they are in LEGO Dimensions. Since the locations from The LEGO Movie are featured in so many games, they will all be composited to be as expansive and accurate to the movie as possible while also having all of the puzzles from LEGO Dimensions, The LEGO Movie 2 Videogame, and this game. To make the open world even more accurate to the movie, Octan Tower will be moved to the far right of Cloud Cuckoo Land and the time of day will change to night when the player travels there. The bonus room will be accessed in a similar way to Manhattan in LEGO Marvel Super Heroes as players will skydive from the broken window in Lord Business' Lair and into the abyss to access it.

LTH

Similar to LEGO City, objects will still drop loot in the Middle Earth hub and levels. The Middle Earth hub itself will be a combination between this game and LEGO The Lord of the Rings: The Video Game with a couple of minor additions from Dimensions to make one massive Middle Earth open world. One change however is that a lot of the random nameless interiors scattered throughout will just be normal areas of the hub.

LB3

Along with the other LEGO games that preceded Skywalker Saga, the fixed camera in the interior hub worlds will be replaced by the proper third-person camera in Skywalker Saga. The spherical Super Mario Galaxy aesthetic for the Lantern planets will be scrapped as well, and those hub worlds will be remastered to be normal flat surfaces like Oa. The rest of Gotham and Metropolis will also be explorable even if the collectables will be locked if the other DC related campaigns haven't been played. The Batman and Robin suits will also be accessed as they are in this game where the player can choose them whenever they want instead of having to find a spawn point in a level or hub. The DLC levels will be treated as regular bonus levels with 3 characters to unlock in each of them.

LJW

Instead of being treated as an entirely separate entity, the larger dinosaurs will be on the character grid and can be accessed whenever the player wants as long as the room can fit them.

LD

The toys-to-life feature will be completely scrapped and the game as a whole will be reworked to be a normal LEGO game. The level packs and story packs can be accessed just like any other bonus level, and obviously the players won't have to pay for any of the content beyond the starter pack with real money. Characters who have exclusive hub worlds behind them with no bonus levels such as Laval, Owen Grady, or Michael Knight will simply be standing next to their respective portals where the player can purchase them. Other characters can be unlocked by doing hub world quests, and many of the NPCs such as Lord Vortech, Dorothy Gale, Tails, or the Ice King will be playable. The jukebox feature will also be implemented into every single hub world in every LEGO game. All of the vehicles will be regular-sized as well rather than microscale, since the game doesn't need to worry about emulating the physical packs and can focus more on making the vehicles more accurate and true to the series. The vehicle upgrades will also be part of the skill tree. The battle arena system will also be reimplemented with a heavy focus on online play. One other minor change is that Lloyd (ZX) will replace the Golden Ninja as Lloyd's appearance in the game.

LMA

The super jump ability introduced in this game will be available for all big-figs from all other LEGO franchises, even for franchises that haven't used it such as The Hobbit, Star Wars, or LEGO Dimensions. Since this is one of the few LEGO games to include a location exclusive to a pre level, being Baron Strucker's Castle, that location will be available in Sokovia. Similar to how you would jump from the hellicarrier to New York, the player will jump from the floating city to the castle on the ground level where they can enter the interior. Manhattan will also have a day and night cycle. In the daytime, it will have the soundtrack from the first LEGO Marvel Superheroes. At sunset or sunrise, it will have the soundtrack from this game. However, at nighttime it will have the Ghostbusters soundtrack. The DLC content will be treated the same way as LEGO Batman 3: Beyond Gotham along with all other LEGO games with DLC on this large scale.

LSW:TFA

The carbonite characters will be regular character tokens, and the non Force Awakens DLC characters will either be unlocked the same way, or be unlocked through some of the open world quests. The Force Awakens characters will continue to stand in certain parts of the hub where they'll be unlocked. The space missions will function a similar way to LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga with the galaxy map. The planets featured in this game will be composited with the ones in Skywalker Saga when it comes to certain areas or quests, and the Millennium Falcon interior will be included in a similar way to the Tardis.

Worlds

Due to this game being a completely different genre to the other LEGO Games, it won't be included. However, some of the characters will be added to the The LEGO Movie 2 Videogame to give it a larger roster and to pay a greater tribute to this game.

LMNV

The skill tree in this game will be part of the upgrades menu along with Skywalker Saga, the combat system and special moves will also be implemented with the same combat system as Skywalker Saga. The animations and combat for a lot of the unlockable characters from Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu will be completely revamped to make them feel more unique and more true to how they are in the show, instead of just recycling the same combat system for all of them. Ninjago City will also be one big hub and will be a lot more open. Unlockable characters will also cost studs instead of being completely free to give the studs more of a purpose.

LMSH2

Even though Manhattan is already featured separately from other LEGO games, Chronopolis will be featured all together as it is in the game to allow it to be more authentic. The team-up ability will also be kept in for all characters. Another major feature that will be kept in is the character bios, as every character will have a description that includes their background information and debut in media or LEGO when it comes to characters like Carnom. There will also be specific descriptions and first appearance dates for some variations of characters. When it comes to real people such as Stan Lee, they will have their writing, acting, directorial, political, art, or video debut listed as their first appearance as well as their debut in LEGO.

LTI

This game was fairly by the books with what it did so there will not be many drastic changes. The super moves will stay in the game. The character unlocks will be normal character tokens instead of the blind bags as well.

LDCSV

The hub world will be split up into different districts accessible across the map and Arkham as well as The Swamp will be taxi locations for Gotham City. Metropolis and Gotham will still be able to be accessed through cable cars since New Jersey and New York are next to each other geographically. The character customizer will serve as the foundation for Lego Legends as it is the most advanced of any LEGO game. The ability to grab enemies and throw them around will be kept in, however the combo moves will be activated separately through the counter attack system. The police system in this game will be kept in all of the other hub worlds, as players will be able to start massive fights with the cops or whatever people are native to that area.

TLM2

Being the LEGO game that changed the formula the most, many of its features will need to be rethought or removed. The item grid will be removed, as characters will have their own abilities and weapons unique to them. The abilities of the super hats and super items will be translated into red bricks which can be found in the lootboxes. Constructions are still able to be unlocked through the loot boxes and will be implemented into the level editor instead of the open world, however, the building ability will still be included for the master builders as part of the puzzles. The aesthetics of many of the hub worlds will be redone to feel less like LEGO Worlds, and more like the other LEGO games. To pay a greater tribute to LEGO Worlds, the characters from that game will be included in the lootbox systems.

LSW:TSS

This game is the foundation for the vast majority of mechanics in The LEGO Game Collection. From the combat system, to the menu, to the abilities, to the ui, to the sidequests, and the layout of the open world. Going more in depth on the combat, the counter attack feature will be how all characters from other LEGO games use their special moves. All bosses from LEGO games will receive the same introduction that the ones in this game get, but the subtitle will be in English instead of Aurebesh. The class system and unique character upgrades are also here. This means that characters like Tech will be able to use protocol droid abilities despite being in a different class. The level challenges will also be here, and many locations exclusive to the pre-levels such as Starkiller Base and the Supremacy will be included as either capital ships or planets. The local space areas will be able to be flown up to similarly to Knowhere in Chronopolis and they will be available in all other planets in this same format, as ships will be accessed like any other air vehicle in any other LEGO game in the hub. Extras in all LEGO games will function the same way that they do in this game, however, the data cards will be replaced by the classic red bricks. Kyber bricks will also function that same way, but they will replaced with gold bricks. Mumble mode will also be available for all games with voice acting, and it won't have forced subtitles. Big figs, however, will be a lot more powerful than they are in this game. Not only will they have the super jump ability and cracked wall, but they'll also have much greater attack damage and health. The jetpacks will also be buffed tremendously for characters such as Boba Fett, Bo-Katan Kryze, ETC and they will function more like the advanced glide ability in LEGO DC Super Villains. One major change that applies to all LEGO games but is particularly strong in this game is that whenever you are in freeplay, the game will always let you switch vehicles and characters no matter what and if you're playing as a character who doesn't fit a certain cinematic sequence or quick-time event, then those moments will just be skipped over. For example, if you were playing Revelations as Davy Jones, the dueling quick-time events will still play out the same way and the game won't make you switch to Luke Skywalker either. However, if you were playing as a character with no sword like Han Solo for example, those sequences would simply be skipped over in order to not strip the player of their freedom. Another minor change is that the Jango Fett boss on Kamino will be a part of the actual Hunt for Jango level. One final change is that the game will not automatically do all of the platforming for you and it is much more similar to how it was in the older LEGO Games, and the enemies will be a lot more aggressive like they were in LEGO Indiana Jones: The Original Adventures or LEGO Batman: The Videogame. These changes will make the game more enjoyable for those who want a more challenging game, however, players can always change the difficulty in settings and revert to the easier gameplay of LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga.

FUNKO FUSION!

Despite not being LEGO related, content from this game will still be included as an expansion to LEGO Dimensions since FUNKO Fusion was made by the same developers as the TT Games LEGO Titles and is meant to serve as a spiritual successor to the LEGO game genre. Nothing FUNKO related such as Freddy and Eddy Funko or the Wonder Factory will be referenced and the plot of the game will not be included outside of some of the bosses such as the Indominus Rex or The Thing still turning purple and giant, but all of the franchises will exist as open worlds with the original levels that can be replayed as any other LEGO game. The open worlds will be made up of all the areas included in the levels but without the objectives, and collectibles will be the exact same in both, as players can choose whether they want to be in a hub world or level-based environment. The main seven franchises will function similarly to the story packs from LEGO Dimensions, while the cameo levels will function similarly to the level packs. Studs will function the exact same way as vinyl. Every character will also have upgraded and more varied melee combat.

Difficulty

Easy - This difficulty will feature hardly any challenge and will hold the player's hand throughout the entire experience. The enemies will be about as passive as they are in LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga if not even more. The game will assist the player with all platforming and even the combat by giving the guns aim bot and having a lock on feature for physical attack as well. Hints will pop-up if the player is taking more than a minute to complete a puzzle, and there will be cinematic camera-pans showing the player where to go and what to do after progressing through the hubs or levels.

Medium - This mode will require more competence from the player but won't be too stressful. Enemies will be more aggressive and there won't be any forced hints, camera-pans, or hand-holdy gameplay.

Hard - The difficulty will be a lot more present in this mode. Enemies will be as aggressive as they are in LEGO Indiana Jones: The Original Adventures if not even more, and if you die, you have to repeat certain sections in the level or sidequest. Invincibility will also be removed as an ability aside from the extra.

Nightmare - Not only will the enemies be at their peak in this mode, but if you die in a level you have to restart the entire level no matter where you are.
